Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis â€“ New York City

Project for Vodafone x AICTE VOIS Internship

ðŸ“– Project Overview

The hospitality industry has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of online platforms facilitating short-term lodging and tourism. Airbnb, Inc., a pioneering American company established in 2008, has reshaped travel accommodation through its innovative online marketplace. Unlike traditional hospitality providers, Airbnb operates on a commission-based model, connecting hosts and guests without owning listed properties.

This project analyzes the New York City Airbnb dataset to extract meaningful insights, identify trends in pricing, availability, and reviews, and understand factors affecting host performance and customer satisfaction.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

This analysis aims to answer the following research questions:

What are the different property types in the dataset?

Which neighborhood group has the highest number of listings?

Which neighborhood group has the highest average price?

Is there a relationship between construction year and price?

Who are the top 10 hosts by listing count?

Do verified hosts receive higher review ratings?

Is there a correlation between price and service fee?

How do review ratings vary by neighborhood group and room type?

Are hosts with more listings more likely to maintain higher availability?
